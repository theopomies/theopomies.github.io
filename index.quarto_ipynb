        "I’m Théo, a graduate of EPITECH and currently CTO of a tech startup, [Kivala](https://www.kivala.fr){target=\"_blank\"}. My background is in AI, large language models, backend development, and data engineering. Over the past years, I’ve worked on building robust backends with Python and FastAPI, designing automation pipelines, and deploying AI systems ranging from custom LLMs to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architectures.\n",

        "* **Backend & automation** — building scalable backends, integrating data pipelines, and streamlining workflows with Python.\n",
        "* **AI agents & RAG systems** — designing conversational agents, retrieval pipelines, and prompt engineering strategies for LLMs.\n",
        "* **Fine-tuning & custom models** — adapting open-source models like LLaMA or Mistral to specific domains, with attention to data quality and deployment.\n",

        "It’s part notebook, part knowledge base, and part exploration. My goal is to document both the practice of building systems and the research side of AI that makes them possible.\n"
