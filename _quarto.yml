    I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur. Currently working on my startup, Kivala, a new kind of interphone and digicode.
    I'm also tryharding AI/ML, from the research to the production (math, kernels, training, inference, deployment, etc.).
    This is where I try to dump my notes and thoughts, throughout the learning journey.
