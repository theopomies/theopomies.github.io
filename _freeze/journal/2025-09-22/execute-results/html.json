But we've decided to ship this update to our existing system. That's running on a completely different tech stack, so I have to duplicate the work and effort, leading to little time for ML.\n\n### ZeRO-2/3\n\nNot much to add. I've begun writing my toy FSDP implementation, not much done yet. I did hit a wall trying to run the same script on my macbook pro and on Modal. torchrun would fail with cryptic issues about IPv6, here's the line to run the script working:\n\n```{sh}\n#| code-overflow: wrap\nGLOO_SOCKET_FAMILY=inet PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1 uv run -m torch.distributed.run --nnodes=1 --node_rank=0 --master_addr=127.0.0.1 --master_port=29500 --nproc_per_node=2 <script.py>\n```\n\n",
