## Definitions & Formulas
### Differentiation

As the name states, we analyze differences in the output(s) of a function based on differences in the input(s)
$$ \dfrac{dy}{dx} = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \dfrac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} $$

A function is said to be differentiable at $x$ if this limit exists, and differentiable on an interval if it exists at any $x$ in this interval.

#### Common Derivatives
From that we can get common derivatives

$$ \begin{aligned}
    \dfrac{d}{dx}C & = 0 && \text{for any constant C} \\
    \dfrac{d}{dx}x^n & = nx^{n - 1} && \text{for n} \neq 0 \\
    \dfrac{d}{dx}e^x & = e^x \\
    \dfrac{d}{dx}\ln x & = x^{-1} \\
    \dfrac{d}{dx}a^x & = \ln(a)a^x \\
    \dfrac{d}{dx}\cos x & = -\sin x \\
    \dfrac{d}{dx}\sin x & = \cos x \\
\end{aligned} $$

From these it becomes trivial to derive $\tan$, $\sec$, $\csc$ and $\cot$.

#### Derivation Rules
Finally a composition of differentiable functions is also differentiable, so we have the following rules that allow us to derive almost any function:

$$ \begin{aligned}
    \dfrac{d}{dx}Cf(x) & = C\dfrac{d}{dx}f(x) && \text{Constant multiple rule} \\
    \dfrac{d}{dx}[f(x) + g(x)] & = \dfrac{d}{dx}f(x) + \dfrac{d}{dx}g(x) && \text{Sum rule} \\
    \dfrac{d}{dx}[f(x)g(x)] & = \dfrac{d}{dx}f(x)g(x) + f(x)\dfrac{d}{dx}g(x) && \text{Product rule} \\
    \dfrac{dy}{dx} & = \dfrac{dy}{dz}\dfrac{dz}{dx} = \dfrac{\frac{dy}{dz}}{\frac{dx}{dz}} && \text{Chain rule} \\
\end{aligned} $$

From these we can easily find a Quotient Rule, a Power Rule and a Reciprocal Rule:

$$ \begin{aligned}
    \dfrac{d}{dx}\dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)} & = \dfrac{\frac{d}{dx}f(x)g(x) - f(x)\frac{d}{dx}g(x)}{g(x)^2} && \text{Quotient rule} \\
    \dfrac{d}{dx}f(x)^n & = nf(x)^{n-1}\dfrac{d}{dx}f(x) && \text{Power rule} \\
    \dfrac{dy}{dx}\dfrac{1}{f(x)} & = -\dfrac{\frac{d}{dx}f(x)}{f(x)^2} && \text{Reciprocal rule} \\
\end{aligned} $$

### Multivariate Calculus

Very similar, but now our function takes a vector $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ as input and returns a scalar $y \in \mathbb{R}$ — or even a vector $\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^m$.

To paraphrase D2L because their explanation is perfect:

Let $y = f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ be a function with $n$ variables.
The *partial derivative* of $y$
with respect to its $i^\textrm{th}$ parameter $x_i$ is

$$ \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial x_i} = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x_1, \ldots, x_{i-1}, x_i+h, x_{i+1}, \ldots, x_n) - f(x_1, \ldots, x_i, \ldots, x_n)}{h}.$$

If $f(\mathbf{x}) = y$, a scalar, we collect/concatenate all the partial derivatives to obtain the _gradient_ of $y$ with respect to $\mathbf{x}$
$$ \nabla_{\mathbf{x}}f(\mathbf{x}) = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial y}{\partial x_1} \\ \vdots \\ \frac{\partial y}{\partial x_n} \end{bmatrix} $$

```{python}
#| echo: false
# TODO: Jacobian
```

#### Handy Rules

The following rules come straight from D2L:

* For all $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ we have $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{A}^\top$ and $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \mathbf{x}^\top \mathbf{A}  = \mathbf{A}$.
* For square matrices $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ we have that $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \mathbf{x}^\top \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}  = (\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{A}^\top)\mathbf{x}$ and in particular
$\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \|\mathbf{x} \|^2 = \nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \mathbf{x}^\top \mathbf{x} = 2\mathbf{x}$.

Then the chain rule states that

$$\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_{i}} = \frac{\partial y}{\partial u_{1}} \frac{\partial u_{1}}{\partial x_{i}} + \frac{\partial y}{\partial u_{2}} \frac{\partial u_{2}}{\partial x_{i}} + \ldots + \frac{\partial y}{\partial u_{m}} \frac{\partial u_{m}}{\partial x_{i}} \ \textrm{ and so } \ \nabla_{\mathbf{x}} y =  \mathbf{A} \nabla_{\mathbf{u}} y,$$

where $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ is a *matrix*
that contains the derivative of vector $\mathbf{u}$
with respect to vector $\mathbf{x}$.

### Integrals

Integrals are

* a way to compute the **signed** area under a curve
* antiderivatives
* a way of adding up tiny bits

$$ \int_a^b f(x)\,dx $$

#### Intuition as sum of rectangles

The integral
$$\int_a^b f(x)\,dx$$
is the *limit of sums of tiny rectangular areas*.

If we cut the interval $[a,b]$ into $n$ equal chunks of width
$$\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n},$$
then the total area is approximated by
$$\sum_{k=1}^{n} f(a + k\Delta x)\,\Delta x.$$

As we make the chunks thinner ($n \to \infty$, so $\Delta x \to 0$), this sum becomes exact:

$$\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} f(a + k\Delta x)\,\Delta x.$$

$\int_a^b f(x)\,dx$ is a **definite integral** of $f(x)$ from $[a,b]$.

$\int f(x)\,dx$ is an **indefinite integral**.

### Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

The fundamental theorem of calculus links differentiation (derivatives) and integration (integrals).

$$ \int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a)$$

Where

$$ \dfrac{d}{dx}F(x) = f(x) $$

#### Intuition

Say we have a function $A(x)$ being the area under the curve of $f(x)$ between $0$ and $x$.

to find the area under the curve between $x$ and $x+h$, we could compute
$$ A(x+h) - A(x) \approx f(x)h $$
$$ \iff \dfrac{A(x+h) - A(x)}{h} \approx f(x) $$
$$ \iff \lim_{h \to 0} \dfrac{A(x+h) - A(x)}{h} = f(x) $$
$$ \iff \dfrac{d}{dx}A(x) = f(x) $$

#### dx
$dx$ = the differential of $x$

A single symbol that means “infinitesimal change in $x$.”

In derivatives, it appears in a ratio ($dy/dx$). We are differentiating $f(x)$ **wrt $x$**.

In integrals, it appears as a piece being added up ($f(x)\,dx$). We are integrating $f(x)$ **wrt $x$**.

### L'Hôpital's Rule

If $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = \lim_{x \to c} g(x) = 0$ or $\pm \infty$, and $\lim_{x \to c} \dfrac{\frac{d}{dx}f(x)}{\frac{d}{dx}g(x)}$ exists, then

$$\lim_{x \to c} \dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to c} \dfrac{\frac{d}{dx}f(x)}{\frac{d}{dx}g(x)}$$

### Implicit Differentiation

We can use
$$a = b \implies \dfrac{d}{dx}a = \dfrac{d}{dx}b$$
to compute derivatives of **relations** (linked variables eg. the equation for a circle centered at the origin and of radius 5: $x^2 + y^2 = 25$)

Or even to compute the derivative of $ln(x)$:

$$\begin{aligned}
y = ln(x) & \iff e^y = x \implies \dfrac{d}{dx} e^y = \dfrac{d}{dx} x \\
& \iff \dfrac{d}{dx} e^y = 1 \\
& \iff e^y\dfrac{d}{dx}y = 1 \\
& \iff \dfrac{d}{dx}y = \dfrac{1}{e^y} \\
& \iff \dfrac{d}{dx}y = \dfrac{1}{e^{ln(x)}} \\
& \iff \dfrac{d}{dx}y = \dfrac{1}{x}
\end{aligned}$$

## Notes

Because of the definition of derivative as a rate of change, this is possible $\dfrac{dy}{dx} = \dfrac{1}{\frac{dx}{dy}}$
