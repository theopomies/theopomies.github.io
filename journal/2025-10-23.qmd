Read my newsletters [bycloud](mail.bycloud.ai){target=_blank} and [AINews](news.smol.ai){target=_blank}.

Read about the new trend in VLMs / OCR -> removing the VAE and and using CLIP / SAM / DINO = Pure vision model backbones.

Watched a video on [subliminal learning by Welch Labs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUAb6zHXqdI){target=_blank} and [Yann LeCunn's talk about JEPA, World Models and the future of AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUmDRxV0krg){target=_blank}.

No AI / ML Code (Only day job code)

Legs workout, deload week, 12/20 RPE (Whoop rates RPE / 20)

### Conclusion

Need to work on more actionnable steps + spend less time on X (1h max).
