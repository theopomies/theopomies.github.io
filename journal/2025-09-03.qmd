Well today I woke up at 5am to go on-site at my startup in Paris (I live 500km away, in Bordeaux) and got home at around 7pm, so not much free time to study, so I just read a bit in the train and ML related stuff was just the evening fireside chat.

### Fireside chat with Yuxiang Wei from Meta FAIR (S2S)

As part of the course (conference) Scratch To Scale, we have a lot of very qualified engineers and researchers from top labs / companies dedicating time for guest lectures or QA sessions.

Today we had the chance to listen to Yuxiang Wei — of Meta FAIR, of the SWE-RL paper — and ask him loads of questions. We discussed topics such as {pre, mid, post}-training, training infrastructure, the advent of RL and its impacts on said infrastructure and more.
