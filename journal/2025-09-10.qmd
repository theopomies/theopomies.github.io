Big day at work today, so I only got the time for the evening call and some time to re-read yesterday's lecture (ZeRO/FSDP)

### FP8

Phuc gave us a nice presentation on how and why to train FP8 precision models. Why do it? To speed up training. Issues: the model diverges suuuuuper fast under full FP8 regime, need to be careful. Solution: mixed precision training. We then saw a quick overview of how frontier labs do it (DeepSeek, Meta etc) and frameworks for it (torch/oa, torchtitan)
