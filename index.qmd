I am a 25-year-old CTO and co-founder of a tech startup, [Kivala](https://www.kivala.fr){target="_blank"}, with a Master's degree in Information Technology from EPITECH. My dual role as both a technical leader and developer allows me to bring a strategic vision to projects.

## Expertise

### Mobile & Full-Stack Development

I specialize in React, React Native, and Next.js, with a strong focus on:

- Rapid development of mobile applications
- Creating and optimizing native modules (iOS/Android, Swift, Kotlin, C++) 
- Maintaining legacy native modules (Objective-C, Java)
- Integrating complex native functionalities
- Designing robust and scalable mobile architectures

From prototyping to production, I ensure a smooth and native user experience.

### Backend Development
I have extensive experience with backend development, particularly in TypeScript, including:

- Designing high-performance, secure APIs
- Choosing between REST or RPC depending on the use case
- Architecting distributed systems
- Integrating complex third-party services

## Approach
With a background as both a full-stack developer and CTO, I combine deep technical expertise with a strong understanding of business challenges and project constraints.
